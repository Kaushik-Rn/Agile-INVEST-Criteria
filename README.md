# Agile-INVEST-Criteria

Creators of User Stories make use of the 'INVEST' criteria as a guide post to write effective User Stories. Here, we try to automate this process through code. 

We make use of NLP libraries with python to validate the User Stories written thus far and recommend actions that the creator of the User Story can consider. This is a POC and can be used as a template or starting point to write your own validations.

Please have a look at this LinkedIn post (https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/agile-invest-criteria-using-spacy-gensim-python-kaushik-r/) that explains at a high level, what the code does.
